detailed step-by-step guide to creating a 3-tier application on GCP using Terraform:

Step 1: Set up your GCP project and service account

Go to the GCP Console and create a new project.
Create a new service account with the necessary roles and permissions to create resources.
Download the service account key and save it in a secure location.
Step 2: Set up your Terraform configuration

Install Terraform on your local machine.
Create a new Terraform configuration file (e.g. main.tf) and initialize it with the necessary provider configuration.
Step 3: Create a VPC network

Define a new VPC network in your Terraform configuration.
Specify the IP range and any other necessary settings.
Create the VPC network using the "terraform apply" command.
Step 4: Create a subnet

Define a new subnet in your Terraform configuration.
Specify the IP range and associate it with the VPC network you created in the previous step.
Create the subnet using the "terraform apply" command.
Step 5: Create a load balancer

Define a new load balancer in your Terraform configuration.
Specify the backend services and health checks.
Create the load balancer using the "terraform apply" command.
Step 6: Create your compute resources

Define your frontend, backend, and database instances in your Terraform configuration.
Specify the necessary machine type, image, and other settings.
Create the instances using the "terraform apply" command.
Step 7: Configure your application (frontend, backend, database)

Configure your frontend instance to serve your application content.
Configure your backend instance to communicate with your frontend and database instances.
Configure your database instance to store and retrieve your application data.
Step 8: Deploy your application

Deploy your application to your frontend and backend instances.
Verify that your application is working properly.
That's a basic overview of the steps involved in creating a 3-tier application on GCP using Terraform. Keep in mind that there may be additional configuration steps depending on the specific requirements of your application.
